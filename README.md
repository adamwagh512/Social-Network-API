## Description
Welcome to my Social Network API application. The purpose of this challenge was to build a backend for a social network using MongoDB. Since there is no front end, all routes were tested using Insomnia. This program was built to satisfy the requirements of Challenge 18 of the University of Texas at Austin coding bootcamp,
## How to Use
1) Go to my Github repository for this project and clone it to your local machine. A link to my github repo for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/adamwagh512/Social-Network-API)! 

2) Take a look at the models, routes and controllers files so you are familiar with the capabilities of this backend

3) Open Insomnia and start hitting some of the routes!

4) Have some fun performing CRUD operations on this backend application

5) I have made a full video walkthough of me using this program. Check it out [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hqgMGxFqQsov1zy95eL29bk1vwF5uHQI/view)!
